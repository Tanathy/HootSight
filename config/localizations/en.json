Expect strong results on large vision datasets when paired with cosine or step decay, but be ready to tune momentum (0.9 is a typical starting point) and keep learning rates in the 0.01-0.1 range depending on batch size.",

Default betas of 0.9/0.999 and eps of 1e-8 suit most workloads. Handles noisy or sparse gradients without manual learning rate scaling, which makes it a reliable baseline for classification and transfer learning. Watch for sluggish convergence if weight decay is coupled to Adam's adaptive updates; consider AdamW when regularization matters.",
      "adamw": "AdamW Optimizer - Decouples weight decay from Adam's adaptive updates so L2 regularization behaves as intended. Keeps the same beta parameters and epsilon defaults as Adam while exposing weight_decay as a true regularizer. Preferred for vision transformers, ResNet fine-tuning, or any model where you care about stable training with predictable generalization. Start with weight_decay around 0.01 and tune learning_rate between 3e-5 and 3e-4 for transfer learning scenarios.",
      "adamax": "AdaMax Optimizer - Adam variant using the infinity norm for second moment tracking. Similar hyperparameters to Adam, but more resilient when gradients have sporadic spikes. Useful when Adam becomes unstable due to extreme gradient magnitudes, particularly in GAN or reinforcement workloads. Keep beta2 near 0.999 and treat learning_rate like standard Adam; expect slightly slower convergence but fewer catastrophic jumps.",
      "nadam": "Nesterov-accelerated Adam - Adds Nesterov momentum on top of Adam's adaptive scaling. Shares the same betas and epsilon but performs a lookahead gradient evaluation, which can tighten convergence on smooth objectives. Plan for a modest compute overhead per step. Recommended when Adam converges but plateaus early; tune learning_rate slightly lower than plain Adam to avoid overshooting (e.g., 1e-4 instead of 3e-4).",
      "radam": "Rectified Adam - Adam with an automatic warmup mechanism derived from variance rectification. Eliminates the need for a manual warmup schedule by shrinking step sizes until running variance stabilizes. Hyperparameters match Adam defaults. Leverage it when you need adaptive behavior but your training is sensitive to the first few hundred steps. Works well for small datasets where manual warmup would overfit.",
      "rmsprop": "RMSprop Optimizer - Maintains an exponential average of squared gradients (alpha) to normalize updates. Defaults to alpha=0.99 and eps=1e-8. Historically popular for recurrent networks and reinforcement learning, it still performs well when gradients oscillate heavily and Adam feels too aggressive. Pair it with a decaying learning_rate schedule; typical starting values land near 1e-3 with momentum disabled or set low (≤0.1).",
      "rprop": "Resilient Backpropagation - Sign-based optimizer that adapts per-parameter step sizes using only gradient sign flips. Ignores batch size because it assumes full-batch updates, so it is rarely appropriate for mini-batch CNN training. Only use it in deterministic settings (e.g., small datasets with full-batch passes) where you want quick second-order-like convergence without storing a Hessian. Hyperparameters eta_plus (1.2) and eta_minus (0.5) govern step adaptation.",
      "adagrad": "Adagrad Optimizer - Accumulates squared gradients, shrinking the learning rate for frequently updated weights. Almost maintenance-free on sparse features, but the cumulative sum forces the effective learning rate toward zero on long runs. Use it for feature embeddings or classical sparse NLP problems, not for deep CNNs that train for hundreds of epochs. Typical initial learning_rate is 1e-2 with epsilon around 1e-10 to avoid division-by-zero.",
      "adadelta": "Adadelta Optimizer - Fixes Adagrad's vanishing learning rate by tracking a moving window of squared gradients and updates. Requires almost no manual tuning beyond rho (0.9) and eps (1e-6). Works on noisy objectives where Adam may be too aggressive, though its final accuracy often trails AdamW. Prefer it when you must avoid manual learning rate schedules and still need adaptive behavior.",
      "sparse_adam": "Sparse Adam - Adam with updates applied only to indices that receive gradients, reducing memory and compute for embedding tables. Uses the same hyperparameters as Adam but assumes gradients are zero almost everywhere. Essential for NLP models with huge vocabularies. Skip it for dense convolutional models; the sparse update bookkeeping just wastes time.",
      "lbfgs": "L-BFGS Optimizer - Limited-memory quasi-Newton method that approximates the inverse Hessian using past gradients. Requires full-batch gradients and a line search per step, so you must implement a closure that recomputes loss and gradients. Excellent for fine-tuning small models or solving convex problems to high precision. Not viable for large mini-batch training because every step is expensive and memory grows with history size (max_iter and history_size control it).",
      "asgd": "Averaged SGD - Maintains a running average of parameters to dampen oscillations caused by noisy gradients. You still tune the base SGD learning_rate, but averaging kicks in after the averaging_start epoch to smooth convergence. Consider it when plain SGD wobbles at the end of training yet you want to avoid switching to Adam. Works best with constant or slowly decaying learning rates and momentum turned off."

Perfect when you already know the epochs where progress slows (e.g., 30/60/90 on ImageNet). Choose gamma between 0.1 and 0.3 and align step_size with your total epoch budget. Without prior knowledge it can feel abrupt, so monitor validation metrics to confirm the drops are helping.",
      "multi_step_lr": "Multi-Step Learning Rate Scheduler - Generalized step schedule that accepts a list of milestone epochs. Lets you stage multiple rate drops at arbitrary points, which is ideal for porting schedules from papers or previous experiments. Keep gamma identical across milestones unless you have a reason to vary it, and make sure milestones are strictly increasing integers.",
      "exponential_lr": "Exponential Learning Rate Scheduler - Applies lr_t = lr_0 * gamma^t, giving you smooth decay in exchange for careful gamma tuning. Works for very long runs where you want a gradual glide instead of discrete jumps. Typical gamma values sit between 0.97 and 0.995 for per-epoch updates. Combine with warmup if the initial slope is too steep for your model.",
      "cosine_annealing_lr": "Cosine Annealing Learning Rate Scheduler - Sweeps the learning rate down following a cosine curve over T_max epochs and optionally restarts at eta_min. Provides gentle landings that boost final accuracy on vision models. Set T_max to the number of epochs in a cycle and eta_min to a small floor such as lr_0 / 100. Use it when you want automatic fine-tuning near the end without manual milestones.",
      "cosine_annealing_warm_restarts": "Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts - Repeats cosine decay cycles, resetting to the initial learning rate after each cycle. Great for escaping shallow minima during long training sessions. T_0 defines the first cycle length, and T_mult scales subsequent cycle lengths. Keep eta_min small but non-zero to avoid freezing the optimizer.",
      "reduce_lr_on_plateau": "Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau - Watches a metric (usually validation loss) and drops the learning rate by factor when improvement stalls for patience epochs. Essential when you cannot predict plateau timing. Configure cooldown to avoid consecutive triggers and use threshold to filter noisy metrics. Gamma between 0.1 and 0.5 typically strikes the right balance.",
      "cyclic_lr": "Cyclic Learning Rate Scheduler - Cycles the learning rate between base_lr and max_lr over short windows, optionally shrinking amplitude using mode. Useful for fast convergence on tough objectives or for LR range tests. Set step_size_up/down to the number of iterations per half-cycle; keep max_lr roughly 3-10× base_lr. Pair with momentum cycling if you enable cycle_momentum.",
      "one_cycle_lr": "One Cycle Learning Rate Policy - Single sweep that ramps learning rate up to max_lr then anneals to a fraction of the base value while inverting momentum. Delivers rapid convergence when total training steps are known. Provide either total_steps or (epochs × steps_per_epoch); set pct_start to define the warmup proportion (0.3 is common). Works best with SGD or AdamW and expects no additional schedulers.",
      "polynomial_lr": "Polynomial Learning Rate Scheduler - Decays learning rate to zero following (1 - t/T)^power. Choose total_iters as the number of optimizer steps in the schedule and power to control curvature (1 for linear, 2 for quadratic). Useful for segmentation and detection workloads where you want a deterministic glide to zero by the final iteration.",
      "linear_lr": "Linear Learning Rate Scheduler - Simple linear interpolation between start_factor and end_factor over total_iters steps. Ideal for warmup (start_factor < 1) or cool-down phases. Keep total_iters aligned with the number of iterations you want the ramp to cover; combine with another scheduler for the remaining training window.",
      "lambda_lr": "Lambda Learning Rate Scheduler - Direct hook that multiplies the base learning rate by your custom lambda(epoch) function. Gives full control for research schedules or curriculum learning. Provide a Python expression that evaluates to a float; remember it will be string-evaluated inside the training process. Validate the function carefully—syntax errors or negative outputs will kill your run.",
      "multiplicative_lr": "Multiplicative Learning Rate Scheduler - Similar to lambda_lr but expects a callable that returns a multiplier each step, often used for epoch-by-epoch scaling. Supply a lambda that depends on optimizer step count rather than epoch if you need per-iteration control. Keep multipliers positive and bounded; values >1 grow the learning rate and can destabilize training fast."

Accepts raw logits, handles class imbalance via weight or label_smoothing, and provides calibrated probabilities. Keep reduction='mean' for stable gradients and monitor label_smoothing so you do not erase minority classes.",

Useful when the model already outputs log-probabilities (e.g., custom temperature scaling or mixed precision under manual control). Make sure inputs are log probabilities; feeding raw logits will silently give garbage.",

Offers optional L1 or L2 norms via parameter p. Use it when you want large-margin behavior instead of probabilistic cross-entropy, but note that it can converge slower without careful learning rate control.",
      "multi_label_margin": "Multi-Label Margin Loss - Extends margin loss to multi-label problems by ranking positive classes ahead of negatives. Requires targets to be encoded as index lists and therefore is tricky to integrate with dense label tensors. Reserve it for research scenarios that explicitly call for margin ranking in multi-label space.",
      "multi_label_soft_margin": "Multi-Label Soft Margin Loss - Applies a soft-margin formulation over sigmoid activations, producing smoother gradients than hard margin losses. Better at handling overlapping labels and imbalance than vanilla BCE. Targets must still be {0,1}; consider threshold tuning at inference to exploit the smoother training landscape.",

      "l1_loss": "L1 Loss (Mean Absolute Error) - Linear penalty on absolute error, offering robustness to outliers at the cost of slower convergence near zero. Use it when you need median-like behavior or when your evaluation metric is MAE. Gradients are constant magnitude, so combine with smooth schedulers to avoid jitter.",
      "smooth_l1": "Smooth L1 Loss - Huber-style loss with a beta region that behaves like L2 near zero and L1 outside. Default choice for bounding-box regression (beta ≈ 1). Tune beta if your scale differs significantly; smaller beta tightens the quadratic window and gives sharper penalties to mid-sized errors.",
      "huber_loss": "Huber Loss - Similar to SmoothL1 but parameterized by delta instead of beta. Offers explicit control over the switch point between quadratic and linear penalties. Excellent for regression tasks with occasional outliers; set delta close to your expected noise standard deviation.",

Requires log-probabilities as input and raw probabilities as target by default (or vice versa with log_target). Essential for knowledge distillation and variational models. Double-check reduction mode; 'batchmean' preserves KL theory (summing over classes and averaging over batch).",
      "margin_ranking": "Margin Ranking Loss - Operates on pairs of scores (x1, x2) with ground-truth ordering y ∈ {−1, 1}. Trains the model to rank x1 above x2 by at least margin when y=1. Combine it with careful sampling of positive/negative pairs or triplets—random pairs rarely convey useful signal.",
      "hinge_embedding": "Hinge Embedding Loss - For similarity learning where labels indicate whether pairs should be close (+1) or far (−1). Penalizes distances that violate the specified margin. Use it when you only have binary same/different supervision and want embeddings clustered accordingly.",
      "triplet_margin": "Triplet Margin Loss - Consumes anchor, positive, and negative embeddings and enforces a margin between positive and negative distances. Requires hard or semi-hard triplet mining to shine; naive random triplets usually waste computation. Margin defaults to 1.0 but tune it based on embedding scale (smaller for normalized vectors).",
      "cosine_embedding": "Cosine Embedding Loss - Optimizes cosine similarity directly, emphasizing angular distance over magnitude. Ideal when vectors are normalized or when direction carries the semantics (e.g., face recognition). Ensure embeddings are normalized to avoid mixing magnitude effects back in.",
      "ctc_loss": "Connectionist Temporal Classification Loss - Aligns variable-length inputs to target label sequences without frame-level annotation. Requires log-probabilities with size (T, N, C) and target sequences without blanks inserted (the loss handles blanks). Configure blank index and ensure targets are sorted by sample; mis-sized target lengths will throw runtime errors.",

Accepts log_input to enforce positive predictions or full logits with clamp to stay above zero. Set full=True if your model predicts raw rates.
